# 🎮 Gavin's Adventure - Setup Instructions

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: You need to generate the sprite files first!

The game currently shows only a few coins because the sprite files haven't been created yet. Here's how to fix this:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Generate All Sprites
1. **Open** `generate_all_sprites.html` in your web browser
2. **Click** the big blue "🎨 Generate ALL Sprites at Once" button
3. **Download** each sprite by clicking the individual download buttons

### 2. Place Files in Correct Directories
```
public/assets/sprites/
├── gavin.png           ← Gavin the adventurer (8 frames)
├── enemy_slime.png     ← Enemy slime (4 frames)
├── coin.png            ← Golden coin (6 frames)
├── checkpoint.png      ← Checkpoint flag (2 frames)
└── door.png            ← Exit door (1 frame)

public/assets/backgrounds/
└── forest_bg.png       ← Forest background (800x600)
```

### 3. Run the Game
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 What You Should See After Setup

- **Gavin the Adventurer**: A buff character with blue shirt and brown hair
- **Beautiful Forest Background**: Mountains, trees, and sky
- **Multiple Platforms**: Brown wooden platforms at different heights
- **Enemy Slimes**: Green bouncing enemies that patrol the level
- **Golden Coins**: Shiny spinning coins scattered throughout
- **Checkpoint Flag**: Red and white flag that saves your progress
- **Exit Door**: Brown door to complete the level

## 🔧 If Sprites Still Don't Load

1. **Check file paths** - Make sure PNG files are in the correct directories
2. **Check file names** - Must match exactly: `gavin.png`, `coin.png`, etc.
3. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Check console errors** - Open browser dev tools (F12) and look for errors

## 🎨 Customizing Sprites

The `generate_all_sprites.html` file contains all the sprite generation code. You can:
- Change colors in the `colors` objects
- Adjust animation timing
- Modify sprite dimensions
- Add new animation frames

## 🚀 Ready to Play!

Once all sprites are generated and placed correctly, you'll have a beautiful, modern platformer with:
- Smooth character animations
- Beautiful pixel art graphics
- Challenging enemy encounters
- Multiple platforms to explore
- Professional visual effects

**Enjoy Gavin's Adventure!** 🗡️⚔️
